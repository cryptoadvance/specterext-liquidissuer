- distribution:
    - if no assignments are valid for distribution -> doesn't return error code
    - after cancel distributions can't create a new one, ever again - I had to create a new asset
    - distribution that is not confirmed yet doesn't appear in the list of distributions

- users
    - If the user was added to categories, then removed and deleted it can't be created again
