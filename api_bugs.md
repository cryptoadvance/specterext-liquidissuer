- assignments
    - delete assignment returns json parsing error
- distribution:
    - cancel distribution returns json parsing error
    - if no assignments are valid for distribution -> doesn't return error code
    - after cancel distributions can't create a new one, ever again - I had to create a new asset
    - distribution that is not confirmed yet doesn't appear in the list of distributions
