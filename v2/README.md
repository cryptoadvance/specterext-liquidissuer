# Amp issuer v2

This is a playground for the new design of the Amp issuer. Currently no JS or backend code is implemented. Communication with Elements Core and the rest of functionality will be implemented before February 15th to hit Blockstream's deadline.

To see the design run a local server in this folder: `python3 -m http.server`.

Implementation as Specter Desktop extension will be done later, after initial MVP with Elements.

Design is implemented in Sketch (MacOS only) - see `design.sketch`.
